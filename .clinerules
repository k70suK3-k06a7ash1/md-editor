## Sensitive Files

DO NOT read or modify:

-   .env files
-   \*_/config/secrets._
-   \*_/_.pem
-   Any file containing API keys, tokens, or credentials

-   Never commit sensitive files
-   Use environment variables for secrets
-   Keep credentials out of logs and output

- To go from the simplest to the most complex perception, and to assume an order among things that has no antecedent or antecedent.
- Finally, a complete enumeration and extensive reconsideration
